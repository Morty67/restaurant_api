# Lunch Decision Backend
This project aims to develop a backend service for an internal lunch decision-making system. The system allows employees to vote for their preferred menu at different restaurants before heading out for lunch. The backend will be responsible for handling user authentication, restaurant management, menu uploading, employee registration, and providing information about the current day's menu and voting results.
